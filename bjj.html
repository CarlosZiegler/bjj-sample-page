    <p class="text-justify">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro) is a martial art and combat sport
      system that focuses on grappling with
      particular emphasis on ground fighting. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was developed from Kodokan judo ground fighting
      (newaza) fundamentals that were taught by a number of Japanese individuals including Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda,
      Soshihiro Satake, and Isao Okano. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through
      the innovations, practices, and adaptation of judo/jujutsu.</p>

            <strong>Origins</strong><br>

            Geo Omori opened the first Jiu-Jitsu / judo school in Brazil in 1909.[11] He taught a number of individuals
            including Luiz França. Later, Mitsuyo Maeda was one of five of the Kodokan's top groundwork (newaza)
            experts that judo's founder Kano Jigoro sent overseas to demonstrate and spread his art to the world. Maeda
            had trained first in sumo as a teenager, and after the interest generated by stories about the success of
            Kodokan Judo at competitions with other jujutsu schools of the time, became a student of Jigoro Kano.[12]
            Maeda left Japan in 1904 and visited a number of countries[12] giving "jiu-do" demonstrations and accepting
            challenges from wrestlers, boxers, savate fighters and various other martial artists before eventually
            arriving in Brazil on November 14, 1914.

            Gastão Gracie was a business partner of the American Circus in Belém. In 1916, Italian Argentine circus
            Queirolo Brothers staged shows there and presented Maeda.In 1917 Carlos Gracie, the eldest son of
            Gastão Gracie, watched a demonstration by Maeda at the Da Paz Theatre and decided to learn judo. Maeda
            accepted Carlos as a student and Carlos learned for a few years, eventually passing his knowledge on to his
            brothers. Gracie's account of the events is that his sibling Hélio Gracie gradually further developed
            Gracie Jiu-Jitsu as a softer, pragmatic adaptation from judo that focused on ground fighting, since he was
            unable to perform many judo moves that require direct opposition to an opponent's strength.

            Although the Gracie family is typically recognized as the main family to first develop Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
            as we know it today, there was also another prominent lineage derived from Maeda via another Brazilian
            disciple, Luiz França.[18] This lineage had been represented particularly by Oswaldo Fadda. Fadda and his
            students were famous for the influential use of footlocks[19] and the lineage still survives through
            Fadda's links in teams such as Nova União and Grappling Fight Team.
            <br>
            <strong>Name</strong>
            <br>
            The name "Jiu-Jitsu" derives from an older romanization of its original spelling in the West (is still in
            common use); the modern Hepburn romanization of 柔術 is "jūjutsu".

            When Maeda left Japan, judo was still often referred to as "Kano jiu-jitsu", or, even more generically,
            simply as Jiu-Jitsu. Higashi, the co-author of Kano Jiu-Jitsuwrote in the foreword:

            Some confusion has arisen over the employment of the term 'jiudo'. To make the matter clear I will state
            that jiudo is the term selected by Professor Kano as describing his system more accurately than jiu-jitsu
            does. Professor Kano is one of the leading educators of Japan, and it is natural that he should cast about
            for the technical word that would most accurately describe his system. But the Japanese people generally
            still cling to the more popular nomenclature and call it jiu-jitsu.

            Outside Japan, however, this distinction was noted even less. Thus, when Maeda and Satake arrived in Brazil
            in 1914, every newspaper announced their art as being "Jiu-Jitsu", despite both men being Kodokan
            judoka.

            It was not until 1925 that the Japanese government itself officially mandated that the correct name for the
            martial art taught in the Japanese public schools should be "judo" rather than "jujutsu". In Brazil,
            the art is still called "Jiu-Jitsu". When the Gracies went to the United States and spread Jiu-Jitsu, they
            used the terms "Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu" and "Gracie Jiu-Jitsu" to differentiate from the already present
            styles using similar-sounding names. In a 1994 interview with Yoshinori Nishi, Hélio Gracie said that he
            didn't even know the word of judo itself until the sport came in the 1950s to Brazil, because he heard that
            Mitsuyo Maeda called his style "Jiu-Jitsu".

            The art is sometimes referred to as Gracie Jiu-Jitsu (GJJ), a name trademarked by Rorion Gracie, but after
            a legal dispute with his cousin Carley Gracie, his trademark to the name was voided.[25] Other members of
            the Gracie family often call their style by personalized names, such as Ceaser Gracie Jiu-Jitsu or Renzo
            Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and similarly, the Machado family call their style Machado Jiu-Jitsu (MJJ). While each
            style and its instructors have their own unique aspects, they are all basic variations of Brazilian
            Jiu-Jitsu. There are currently four major BJJ branches in Brazil: Gracie Humaita, Gracie Barra, Carlson
            Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and Alliance Jiu Jitsu. Each branch traces its roots back to Mitsuyo Maeda via Donato
            Pires Dos Reis,[26] and then through the Gracie family or Oswaldo Fadda.

            Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has vast similarities to the original Kodokan Judo, widely practiced before
            Judo became part of the Olympics, and still practiced in lesser extent, as well as some
            similarity to earlier ryu (schools) Ju-Jitsu.[33] It has also been argued that the Brazilians didn't
            actually create any fundamental innovations within the art,[34] This has led some practitioners to suggest
            that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu should just be called "Jiu-Jitsu"[35] or even Kosen Judo.

                    <h4>Teaches you the value of hard work</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">When you start out you are getting thrown and submitted at will. But you
                      will start to see that
                      as you
                      put more time into your practice, it takes you longer to lose, and you lose less and less. And
                      then you
                      put more time in you will eventually win against those that you were unable to beat before. And
                      by that
                      time, you are now the one throwing and submitting guys in class. Judo and jiu jitsu teaches you
                      the value
                      of hard work, because you actually get to see the fruits of your labor every time you spar. Your
                      progress
                      can be seen; it’s tangible. This lesson in jiu jitsu and judo can be taken and applied to all
                      areas of
                      your life. Getting good at judo and jiu jitsu is just like getting good at anything else, you
                      need to
                      stay the path, be consistent, and practice mindfully. Your progress in judo and jiu jitsu is an
                      allegory
                      for progress in life.</p>

                    <h4>It promotes persistence and grit</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">For the first few months, I was getting extremely frustrated and felt like
                      I wasn’t making any
                      progress.
                      I was getting tossed around like a rag doll in judo and got submitted every 30 seconds in jiu
                      jitsu.
                      There were many nights where I just dreaded going to class knowing that I am going to get my butt
                      handed
                      to me when I spar. But you know what? I started getting better. I started lasting a lot longer
                      when I
                      sparred. Then after a bit longer, I started submitting and throwing people myself. And right now,
                      I am at
                      the point where I can defeat some people much bigger than me. I wouldn’t have been able to get to
                      this
                      point had I not showed up to class and be willing to lose over and over again.

                    <h4>Gets you to face your fears</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The fear of being physically hurt is a strong emotion that holds many
                      people back from many of
                      life’s
                      more enjoyable activities. Judo and jiu jitsu does not sugarcoat the fact that they are combative
                      sports—-pain is part of the game. And while injuries do happen, precautions are taken to make
                      sure that
                      you are as safe as possible. The people that stay with judo and jiu jitsu are eventually able to
                      face
                      their fears of being hurt, by forcing themselves to take the pain and becoming resistant to their
                      fear of
                      pain as a result. In essence, judo and jiu jitsu teaches you to face your fears head on, not
                      subverting
                      or diverting it. Once you have done judo and jiu jitsu for awhile, you will find that most of
                      your fears
                      of permanent physical damage are unfounded, most of the time. And that is an analogy for many of
                      our
                      fears in life, it is not based off of actual evidence, it is based off of either isolated
                      one-time
                      incidents, our emotions, and/or how we view the world.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Practicing judo and jiu jitsu is going to hurt and it is going to be
                      painful (see above point).
                      As far
                      as physical pain goes, judo is one of the roughest sports out there. The sport places a HUGE
                      emphasis on
                      safety, but you are going to get thrown to the ground, a lot. That is just the how it is. But as
                      you get
                      thrown more often, your body starts to toughen up and absorb the pain a lot better. Then, it
                      won’t hurt
                      as much. This is akin to kickboxers toughening up their shins to the point where cutting down
                      trees with
                      their shins no longer hurts.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Mental toughness is a big reason why I continue with jiu jitsu and judo.
                      The two sports teach
                      you to
                      fight through discomfort and pain. It teaches you to fight back when you are backed against the
                      wall. It
                      teaches you that you should not be afraid to fight someone bigger or more skilled than you. US
                      Judo
                      Olympian Will Dampier said this of Judo, “[b]eing thrown around makes you physically tough, but
                      Judo also
                      builds mental toughness; knowing you can go up against a guy twice your size and still win is a
                      great
                      feeling.”</p>

                      it is more technique-oriented. I am 140 pounds but I have beaten people almost twice my size.

                      because you have been given skills to defend yourself and hold your own. But more importantly,

                      is ridiculous. Judo
                      and jiu
                      jitsu works out both your anerobic and aerobic systems, giving you great cardio endurance. In
                      addition to
                      working on your cardio, the sports also help you build muscles, often in areas that are least
                      developed.
                      The two grappling arts use muscles very rarely used during the day—so it gives you a chance to
                      develop
                      major muscle groups along with muscles that you would not otherwise develop just lifting weights.
                      I
                      gained over 10 pounds of muscle within the past year without the aid of weightlifting; all I did
                      was jiu
                      jitsu and judo, with a little boxing and kickboxing mixed in. On top of cardiovascular and
                      muscular
                      strength, the sports also give you increased agility, reflex, and balance.</p>

          <p class="text-justify"> While there are numerous local and regional tournaments administered regularly by
            private individuals and
            academies, there are two major entities in Jiu-Jitsu circles. First, is the Sport Jiu Jitsu International
            Federation (SJJIF), a (nonprofit) organization with international federations and tournaments. Second, is
            the
            International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF), an organization that hosts a number of major
            tournaments worldwide. These include the Pan American Championship, European Championship, and the
            Mundials.
            California, New York, and Texas are the three states in the US which host tournaments most frequently.
            Other
            promotions within North America, such as Battleground Grappling Championship, American Grappling Federation
            (AGF), North American BJJ Federation (NABJJF), and North American Grappling Association (NAGA) host
            tournaments nationwide, but visit these states multiple times within a tournament season.</p>
